Meditation and kids might not sound like a match made in heaven. Kids between the ages of ten to fourteen lead busy and active lives, it’s a time of fast transition and emotional & cognitive development. Where can they get some rest and some quiet time with all of that buzzing? Ohmmmm is a game that makes meditation fun and engages kids to slow down and relax.
